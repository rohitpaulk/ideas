# Sudoku

- Two modes. a) Collab, b) Compete.
- Collab
  - Multiple players play on the same sudoku board.
  - Google docs-style cursors to show the boxes a user is looking at.
  - End of game, show stats on number of boxes filled by users. User with more boxes filled wins.
  - Teams can compete.
- Compete
  - Same puzzle, different boards for each player.
  - Shortest time - wins.
  - Can be played async, I play today and same puzzle gets sent to my friends tomorrow.
