# Social Network for Recipes/Chefs

- Structured data for ingredients, steps, times etc.
- Allow users to discover recipes based on what they have available in the kitchen.
- Just like [Collaborative Checklists](), record times + support alternative interfaces that encourage active interaction.
- Allow comments on each step, show top ranked by default - "If you're using a cast iron pan, saute for 5 minutes extra."
- Track executions, display timeline.
