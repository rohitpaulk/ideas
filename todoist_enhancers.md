# Todoist Enhancers

While Todoist is a great product, there are some parts of it that are seriously below par.

### Analytics

Todoist holds a _lot_ of information around the tasks one completes over time,
but doesn't expose analytics on them.

There are two places where this is exposed currently in Todoist:

- Productivity dropdown, where you see task counts with project colors attached to it.
- Year in Review. Shares aggregates and patterns, but drill down view individual tasks. Also,
  this is only shared yearly.

What if you could:

- Look at the tasks you completed. Filter by date of completion / project / tags
- Find which recurring tasks get done on time, and which ones get rescheduled the most
- See what the most productive time of day is, and how that has changed over months?

### Creating Filters

Todoist's filters are extremely powerful, but are a pain to create. There's a
'syntax' to learn and not realtime feedback when making a change.

What if this filter creation process was visual, and you could see instant
feedback as you build the filter?
