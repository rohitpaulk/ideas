# Collaborative Recurring Checklists

- Use data on checklist step times. "Step 2/6 usually takes 20mins, but took 60 mins today. Something went wrong? Add a comment to help the next person"
- Don't rely on user to go and manually tick each step. Explore alternative interfaces that encourage active interaction rather than passive:
  - Mobile UI that is primarily based on a single swipe. Swipe right for the next step. Ding-Dong when a specific step is due.
  - Alexa. User says: "Alexa, I'm done. What's next?". Alexa says: "Are you done with xx yet?"
  - Slack/chatbot - "Next step is up for grabs. [Click here to claim]". "Alex is working on step 2. Estimated time: 20mins"
- Support parallel/sequential pipelines of steps. Not sure if this is a great idea, could complicate things.
- Allow sharing checklists publicly.
- Allow forking checklists, suggesting changes.
- Potential use cases:
  - Pilot checklists
  - Surgeon checklists
  - Recipes
  - Code deploys that involve multiple steps
  - Incident Response checklists
